### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://fem-blog-preview-card.vercel.app/)

## Overview

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### What I learned

It was nice to set up a fresh project and go through all the hassle of installing the custom font and figuring out how to reference it in Vite versus Next. I also hadn't create custom box-shadows with Tailwind before.

### Continued development

I look forward to spending more time with the Tailwind theming in the next project. And I may use Next, since it has a setup option for Tailwind when you build the package.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/) - I just found out about this site, but I'm going to keep it around as it's a great reference.
